# Code of Conduct                                                                           
                                                                                            
In general I want to promote the standards defined by the [Contributor Covenant
Code of
Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/),
but I am a single person, this is not a big (or small) organization, and I have
no experience dealing with these situations, I prefer keep it simple for now,
but when in doubt, please take the *Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct* as
reference.

I basically ask contributors to play nice, be respectful and mindful with other
contributors and users and don't discriminate on any ground.

Please do contact me (luca-conduct@llucax.com) if you feel offended by the
actions or saying of any contributors (including myself, which could be
a tricky thing to do, but I'll do my best to be introspective and acknowledge
and correct my own behaviour). I'll do my best to take corrective actions.
